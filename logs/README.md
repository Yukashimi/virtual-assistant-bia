The first line is the date and time the input was written down.
Then we have the list of detected intents by Watson's API, please note that by default the API only returns the highest confidence score, to change that include `alternate_intents: true` to the payload.
The [USER] and [BOT] tags are the messages inputted by the user and the output generated by Watson's API.
